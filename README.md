# BigBookOfSmallPythonProjects

I am working through Al Sweigart's Big Book of Small Python Projects.

Each project provides an opportunity to practice a skill in Python:

1. Bagels - using constants
2. Birthday Paradox - using datetime
3. Bitmap Message - multi-line strings

To run each project, install python, clone the repository to a folder of your choosing. Navigate to the chosen folder in your terminal and type python3 projectname.py.
