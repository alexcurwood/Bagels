# BigBookOfSmallPythonProjects

I am working through Al Sweigart's Big Book of Small Python Projects.

Each project provides an opportunity to practice a skill in Python:


| Project Name     | Concept            | Terminal command to run    |
| :--------------: |:------------------:| :-------------------------:|
| Bagels           | Constants          | python3 bagels.py          |
| Birthday Paradox | Datetime           | python3 birthdayparadox.py |
| Bitmap Message   | Multi-line strings | python3 bitmapmessage.py   |
| Blackjack        | Unicode characters | python3 blackjack.py


To run each project, install Python, and clone the repository to a folder of your choosing. Navigate to the chosen folder in your terminal and type the command as above.
